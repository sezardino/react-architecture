# **stores**

The `stores/` folder contains **global state management** for the application. This folder is used for managing and sharing state across components that are not directly related, ensuring a centralized way of handling the application’s state. We typically use tools like Zustand, Redux, or any other state management libraries here to manage the shared state that needs to be accessed or modified from multiple parts of the application.

### **Purpose**

- **Global State Management**: The main goal of this folder is to manage application-wide state (e.g., UI states, user authentication, theme preferences) that can be accessed by various components across the app.
- **Centralized Logic**: The logic for managing the state is centralized in the store, making it easier to handle updates and debugging.
- **Custom Store Logic**: The store should encapsulate all logic for the state management, so components only interact with the state via the store’s API.

### **Structure**

```

stores/
├── layoutStore.ts  # Zustand store for layout state (sidebar, theme, etc.)
```

### **Example: Layout Store using Zustand**

A common use case for a store is managing UI states, such as opening/closing a sidebar. Here's an example of how a Zustand store can manage the state for a sidebar (e.g., whether the sidebar is open or closed):

```tsx
import create from "zustand";

// Store for managing layout states (sidebar, modal, etc.)
interface LayoutState {
  isSidebarOpen: boolean;
  toggleSidebar: () => void;
  closeSidebar: () => void;
  openSidebar: () => void;
}

export const useLayoutStore = create<LayoutState>((set) => ({
  isSidebarOpen: false,
  toggleSidebar: () =>
    set((state) => ({ isSidebarOpen: !state.isSidebarOpen })),
  closeSidebar: () => set({ isSidebarOpen: false }),
  openSidebar: () => set({ isSidebarOpen: true }),
}));
```

### **Usage in Components**

Now, you can use this store in your components to manage the sidebar state.

For example, in your layout component, you can access the store like this:

### **When to Use Stores**

- **Global UI State**: If your application has UI elements like modals, sidebars, or notifications that need to be controlled from different parts of the application, use stores.
- **Shared State**: When multiple components need access to the same piece of state (e.g., authentication status, user data, theme preferences), a store is a good place to manage that state.
- **Complex Logic**: If the logic for managing state involves several conditions or transformations, encapsulate that logic inside a store to keep your components clean and focused on rendering.

### **Conclusion**

The `stores/` folder is responsible for managing global application state, allowing components to interact with shared state in a consistent and centralized manner. Zustand is a simple and flexible library that is perfect for small to medium-sized applications where you need to manage UI states and other global state logic in a scalable way.
