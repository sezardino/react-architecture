# **UI**

The `ui/` folder contains atomic, presentational components that serve as the basic building blocks of the application. These components are designed to be highly reusable and simple, focusing solely on rendering UI elements without any complex logic or state management. The components in this folder are typically the smallest units (atoms) that are combined into more complex components within other parts of the application, such as modules or forms.

## **Structure**

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/
│       ├── Button.tsx          # Reusable button component
│       ├── Input.tsx           # Reusable input field component
│       ├── Icon.tsx            # Reusable icon component
│       ├── Checkbox.tsx        # Reusable checkbox component
```

### **Purpose**

The components in the `ui/` folder are basic and focus purely on rendering simple UI elements. These components are typically:

- **Atoms** – The smallest possible UI elements, like buttons, inputs, labels, and icons.
- **Stateless** – These components do not handle any state or business logic, and rely entirely on props for rendering.
- **Highly Reusable** – These components are designed to be used in various places across the application to build more complex components.

### **Example**

For example, in the `ui/` folder, we may have components like:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/
│       ├── Button.tsx      # A basic button component
│       ├── Input.tsx       # A basic input field component
│       ├── Icon.tsx        # A basic icon component
```

In this structure:

- **Button.tsx** would be a simple button component that accepts `props` like `label`, `onClick`, `style`, etc., and renders a button element.
- **Input.tsx** would be a simple input field component that accepts `value`, `onChange`, `placeholder`, etc., and renders an input element.
- **Icon.tsx** would be a component that renders an icon (for example, using an SVG or font icon), accepting `name` or `src` as props.

### **Key Principles**

- **Atomic Design** – The components are designed to be the smallest reusable building blocks (atoms) that are combined to create more complex UI elements.
- **Separation of Concerns** – UI components do not handle any logic, state, or business operations; they simply render UI based on the props passed to them.
- **Reusability** – Components are highly reusable throughout the application and can be composed together in different contexts to form larger components.

## **Conclusion**

The `ui/` folder plays a key role in the overall UI structure of the application by providing simple, reusable components that serve as the foundational building blocks. These components ensure consistency across the app and can be composed to create more complex UI elements without adding unnecessary complexity or business logic.
