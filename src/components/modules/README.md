# **Modules**

The `modules/` folder contains complex components that are used across different domains of the application. These components are responsible for presenting and managing features related to specific domains, but without including any business logic or state management. Instead, they focus purely on how the UI for these features is structured and rendered.

## **Structure**

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── modules/
│       ├── auth/     # Auth-related components (e.g., Login, Register)
│       ├── cart/     # Cart-related components (e.g., CartSummary, CartItem)
│       ├── user/     # User-related components (e.g., UserProfile, UserSettings)

```

### **Purpose**

The components in the `modules/` folder are focused on UI presentation for specific application features. They may include:

- **UI Layout** – Components that organize the layout of the application in relation to specific features (e.g., login forms, cart items).
- **Reusable UI Elements** – Components like buttons, inputs, and other form elements that are specific to the domain and reused across the application.
- **Feature-Specific Components** – Higher-level components that represent entire features but without internal state or business logic.

### **Example**

For example, in the `layouts/` module, we may have components like:

```
modules/
├── layouts/
    ├── header.tsx       # Login form UI component
    ├── sidebar.tsx    # Registration form UI component
    ├── footer.tsx  # Header UI component for auth-related pages
```

In this structure:

- **Login.tsx** and **Register.tsx** are components purely for rendering the login and registration forms, without any business logic or form handling.
- **AuthHeader.tsx** is a simple header component for authentication-related pages, which only handles UI.

### **Key Principles**

- **Domain-Based Organization** – Components are organized by domain (e.g., `auth`, `cart`, `user`), ensuring related components stay together and can be reused in various parts of the application.
- **Separation of Concerns** – The `modules/` folder contains only presentational components, focusing on UI structure without any business logic or state management, which should be handled outside of these components (e.g., in the pages or containers).
- **Reusability** – Each component is designed to be reusable in various places within the domain, or across different parts of the application.

## **Conclusion**

The `modules/` folder contains domain-specific UI components that are important for maintaining a clean and organized application structure. By focusing on UI presentation and avoiding business logic, these components are highly reusable, modular, and easy to maintain.
